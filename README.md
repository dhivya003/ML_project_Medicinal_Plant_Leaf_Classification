# ML_project_Medicinal_Plant_Leaf_Classification
🌿 Medicinal Plant Leaf Classification

🚀 Overview

This project focuses on using machine learning to classify medicinal plants based on their leaf features. By leveraging image processing and classification techniques, this tool can identify medicinal plants accurately, aiding researchers, botanists, and enthusiasts in plant identification.

✨ Features

Image Preprocessing: Noise removal, resizing, and normalization.
Feature Extraction: Using algorithms like Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) or Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
Classification Model: Trained using state-of-the-art models such as SVM, Random Forest, or a CNN-based deep learning model.
Accuracy Metrics: Evaluate performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
User-Friendly Interface: Potential to integrate with a web app or desktop application for ease of use.
